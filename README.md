Sentiment Prediction of Hausa comments using Lexicon &amp; Machine Learning

R programming was first used to create sentiment scores for comments, whereby negative comments have negative scored while positive comments have positive scores. 

Machine Learning was then used to train a model for prediction of both positive and negative comments.
